# Editing Existing Decks

Use this flow when you have a `.pptx` you did not generate from an outline, and
you need to change it without rebuilding from scratch.

## Preserve First

Inspect a standalone reference deck before editing it:

```bash
python3 scripts/reference_deck.py inspect \
  --input deck.pptx \
  --output reference_deck_manifest.json
```

The manifest records stable PowerPoint slide/shape IDs, object types,
editability, geometry/style/text hashes, and alt text. For a narrow text or
alt-text edit, author a typed `reference_deck_patch_v1` plan against those IDs:

```bash
python3 scripts/reference_deck.py patch \
  --input deck.pptx \
  --plan patch.json \
  --output deck_v2.pptx \
  --report patch_report.json
```

Only `replace_text` and `set_alt_text` are registered. Text and alt-text
preconditions reject stale plans. The patch writes a new deck and proves that
untouched object identity, geometry, style, and text remained unchanged.

## Four Tools, Four Levels

1. `scripts/reference_deck.py` — guarded, preserve-by-default object patches.
2. `scripts/edit_deck.py` — broader python-pptx edits for common cases.
3. `scripts/unpack_pptx.py` + `scripts/pack_pptx.py` — XML-level edits.
4. Outline rebuild (`scripts/build_deck.py`) — anything structural or stylistic.

Pick the lowest-level tool that can do the job.

## Use `edit_deck.py` For

- Replacing literal strings across every shape, table cell, and speaker note (`replace-text`). Charts, SmartArt, and slide-master text are not covered; see the gap list below.
- Listing slide titles to confirm indexes before a destructive op (`list-slides`).
- Dropping a slide by 1-based index (`delete-slide`).
- Any small text or metadata tweak on a deck you don't have an outline for.

```bash
python3 scripts/edit_deck.py list-slides --input deck.pptx
python3 scripts/edit_deck.py replace-text \
  --input deck.pptx --output deck_v2.pptx \
  --find "Q3 2025" --replace "Q4 2025"
python3 scripts/edit_deck.py delete-slide \
  --input deck.pptx --output deck_trim.pptx --index 3
```

### Output safety (applies to `replace-text` and `delete-slide`)

Both subcommands refuse to clobber data by default:

- If `--output` already exists, you must pass `--overwrite` or the script
  exits 3 with an error on stderr.
- If `--output` resolves to the same path as `--input`, the script always
  refuses and exits 3. Point `--output` at a different file. This is a hard
  rule — `--overwrite` does not unlock same-path writes, because a partial
  save would corrupt the source deck.

### What `replace-text` scans

Matches work at the run level to preserve formatting. A match that spans two
runs (e.g. because PowerPoint split styling mid-word) will not be caught.

Covered:

- Every shape's text frame on every slide.
- Every cell's text frame in every table (including tables inside group shapes).
- Group shapes (recursively).
- Speaker-notes text on each slide.

NOT covered (known gaps — use `unpack_pptx.py` + XML edits if you need these):

- Chart titles, axis labels, data labels, and chart data.
- SmartArt diagram text.
- Slide master / slide layout text (e.g. footer placeholders inherited from
  the master).

Run `list-slides` after a replace to sanity-check, and run the QA gate
afterward (see below).

### `--require-match` on `replace-text`

By default `replace-text` exits 0 even when 0 occurrences are found (the
output file is still written as a copy). Pass `--require-match` to exit 4
and skip writing the output if the find string produced no matches. Use this
in scripts where a silent no-op is a bug.

```bash
python3 scripts/edit_deck.py replace-text \
  --input deck.pptx --output deck_v2.pptx \
  --find "Q3 2025" --replace "Q4 2025" \
  --overwrite --require-match
```

Notes on `delete-slide`: the slide's `sldId` is removed from `sldIdLst` and the
relationship is dropped. The slide part is left in the package as an orphan,
which PowerPoint ignores. This is the standard python-pptx workaround — there
is no public delete API.

## Use Outline Rebuild For

- Layout changes (hero opener, split panel, card grid, comparison, etc.).
- Style or palette changes, font swaps, or theme token updates.
- Adding slides that need to participate in the skill's visual system.
- Anything where `references/reproducible_workflow.md` rules apply.

If the deck didn't come from an outline, extract one first:

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_outline.py --input deck.pptx --format json \
  --output outline.json
```

Then edit `outline.json` and rebuild with `build_deck.py`.

## Use `unpack_pptx.py` / `pack_pptx.py` For

XML-level edits python-pptx can't cleanly express. Examples:

- Custom XML tags, custom properties, or embedded JSON in a slide part.
- Swapping embedded media (images, audio, video) at the package level.
- Repairing broken relationships or content types.
- Scripted find-replace inside theme or master XML.
- Adapting an existing branded `.pptx` as a template (see next section).

```bash
python3 scripts/unpack_pptx.py --input deck.pptx --outdir /tmp/deck-unpacked \
  --pretty-print --escape-smart-quotes
# edit files under /tmp/deck-unpacked/ (ppt/slides/slideN.xml, etc.)
python3 scripts/clean_unpacked.py --input /tmp/deck-unpacked
python3 scripts/pack_pptx.py --indir /tmp/deck-unpacked --output deck_new.pptx
```

Flags worth using:

- `--pretty-print` reformats every `.xml`/`.rels` part with 2-space indent
  and keeps the conventional OOXML prefixes (`p:`, `a:`, `r:`). Makes
  hand-editing readable; semantically identical to the original.
- `--escape-smart-quotes` replaces `" " ' ' – — …` with XML numeric
  entities (`&#x201C;`, etc.). Generic text editors that normalize unicode
  will otherwise quietly corrupt the glyphs on save.

`pack_pptx.py` writes `[Content_Types].xml` first and uses DEFLATE, which is
what PowerPoint expects. Do not rezip with a shell `zip` command; ordering and
compression flags matter.

Always run `clean_unpacked.py` before `pack_pptx.py`. Edits that delete or
swap slides leave orphans (slide XML files not referenced from
`presentation.xml`, media files not referenced from any slide's `.rels`,
stale `Content_Types.xml` overrides). The cleaner walks the rels graph,
removes everything unreachable, and loops until fixed-point so one pass
handles cascades.

## Template-adaptation workflow

If the user wants a new source-driven deck inspired by an existing PPTX, do
not start by unpacking and cloning slide XML. Extract the measurable style
signals first, then merge the emitted fragment into the new workspace's
`design_brief.json`:

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_pptx_style.py \
  --input template.pptx \
  --report decks/my-deck/style_extract_report.json \
  --markdown-report decks/my-deck/style_extract_report.md \
  --design-brief-fragment decks/my-deck/style_extract_design_brief.json

python3 scripts/apply_pptx_style_fragment.py \
  --workspace decks/my-deck \
  --fragment decks/my-deck/style_extract_design_brief.json \
  --report decks/my-deck/style_fragment_apply_report.json
```

For a reference corpus, point `--input` at the folder and add `--recursive`.
The extraction report and applied notes include fast/rendered
`build_header_variant_gallery.py` commands for previewing the imported preset
and header-variant pool on actual slides before committing to the style.
Use the report for bounded choices such as header variants, footer/source-line
behavior, page numbers, palette candidates, text-size floors, and
figure/table-first posture. The apply step records those choices in
`design_brief.json` and `notes.md`; use `--preserve-existing` for a workspace
that already has intentional style decisions. Continue through the normal
workspace build and QA pipeline.

When the user brings a branded `.pptx` and wants its look applied to new
content, you do NOT rebuild from outline — you adapt the template. The
workflow:

1. **Analyze the template** with a thumbnail grid and a text extraction:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/thumbnail.py --input template.pptx --output template-grid.jpg
   python3 -m markitdown template.pptx > template-text.md
   ```
   The grid shows you every layout in one image; markitdown surfaces
   placeholder text (e.g., `"XXXX"`, `"Lorem ipsum"`, `"Click to add
   title"`) you will need to replace or delete.
2. **Plan slide mapping**: for each content section of the new deck, pick
   the best-matching template slide. **Use varied layouts** — monotonous
   decks are the default failure mode. Actively mix:
   - Multi-column (2-column, 3-column)
   - Image + text compositions
   - Full-bleed or half-bleed image slides
   - Quote / callout slides
   - Section dividers
   - Stat / number callouts
   - Icon grid or icon + text rows
   Don't default to "title + bullets" for every slide.
3. **Unpack**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/unpack_pptx.py --input template.pptx \
     --outdir /tmp/template-unpacked --pretty-print --escape-smart-quotes
   ```
4. **Structural edits** — get slide count and order right BEFORE editing
   content. Duplicate slides you'll reuse, delete ones you won't,
   reorder via the `<p:sldIdLst>` in `ppt/presentation.xml`:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/add_slide.py duplicate \
     --input /tmp/template-unpacked --source slide2.xml
   # Prints an <p:sldId .../> line to insert into sldIdLst
   ```
   For a brand-new slide that pulls only a layout:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/add_slide.py from-layout \
     --input /tmp/template-unpacked --layout slideLayout3.xml
   ```
   **Complete all structural changes before step 5.** Reordering after
   text edits risks losing tracked changes inside the duplicate.
5. **Content edits per slide**: update `<a:t>` text runs inside each
   `ppt/slides/slideN.xml`. Rules:
   - Bold every title, section header, and inline label ("Status:",
     "Description:") by setting `<a:rPr b="1">` on the run.
   - **Never** insert unicode bullets (`•`). Use the layout-inherited
     bullet or add `<a:buChar char="•"/>` / `<a:buAutoNum type="arabicPeriod"/>`
     in `<a:pPr>`. Plain `•` produces doubled bullets on some themes.
   - Preserve `xml:space="preserve"` on `<a:t>` runs with leading or
     trailing whitespace — dropping it collapses indentation.
   - Smart quotes: if you unpacked with `--escape-smart-quotes`, keep
     them as entities (`&#x201C;` etc.). Don't "normalize" back to `"`.
   - Multi-item content (e.g., a 4-step process): one `<a:p>` per step.
     Do not concatenate into one paragraph with `\n`.
   - If the template has 4 placeholders and you have 3 items, **delete
     the full shape group** (text box plus any icon/image siblings),
     not just the text — otherwise you keep floating frames.
6. **Clean orphans**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/clean_unpacked.py --input /tmp/template-unpacked
   ```
7. **Pack**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/pack_pptx.py --indir /tmp/template-unpacked \
     --output branded_deck.pptx --overwrite
   ```
8. **QA** — same gate as any other deck:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/qa_gate.py --input branded_deck.pptx \
     --outdir /tmp/branded-qa --strict-geometry
   python3 scripts/render_slides.py --input branded_deck.pptx \
     --outdir /tmp/branded-renders --emit-visual-prompt
   ```
   The visual-QA subagent pass catches placeholder leaks
   (`"XXXX"`, `"Click to add title"`) that slipped the content edit.

### XML-editing gotchas

- Use `defusedxml.minidom` or stdlib `xml.etree.ElementTree` for XML
  parsing when you need structure; never `sed`/`awk` for anything beyond
  trivial literal swaps, which will corrupt CDATA sections.
- ET rewrites namespace prefixes as `ns0:`/`ns1:` unless you call
  `ET.register_namespace("p", "http://.../presentationml/...")` etc.
  before serialization. `unpack_pptx.py --pretty-print` handles this for
  you; if you're doing your own serialization, register the prefixes.
- Parallel slide-XML edits are safe — slides are independent XML files,
  so subagents can edit several in parallel if the deck is large.
- `replace-text` on `edit_deck.py` is run-level; a match that spans runs
  (styled mid-word) won't fire. Either split the run first or fall back
  to raw XML.

## Mandatory QA After Any Edit

Text replacement often overflows. A 20-character phrase becoming a 40-character
phrase is the single most common regression, and it will not be obvious from a
JSON diff. Re-run the gate:

```bash
python3 scripts/qa_gate.py \
  --input deck_v2.pptx \
  --outdir /tmp/pptx-qa-edit \
  --style-preset executive-clinical \
  --strict-geometry
```

If overflow is reported, either shorten the replacement, widen the box via an
outline rebuild, or fall back to a manual layout fix in the source deck.
